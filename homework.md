# SQL Homework

The GFT is having a Marvel Movie Marathon! They have asked you to help maintain their database of movies with times and attendees.

## To access the database:

First, create a database called 'marvel'

```
# terminal
createdb marvel
```

Next, run the provided SQL script to populate your database:

```
# terminal
psql -d marvel -f marvel.sql
```

Use the supplied data as the source of data to answer the questions.  Copy the SQL command you have used to get the answer, and paste it below the question, along with the result they gave.

## Questions

1. Return ALL the data in the 'movies' table.

SELECT * FROM movies;

2. Return ONLY the name column from the 'people' table

SELECT name FROM people;

3. Oh bother! Someone at CodeClan spelled Campbell's name wrong! Change it to reflect the proper spelling (change 'Cambel Millar' to 'Campbell Miller').

4. Return ONLY your name from the 'people' table.

SELECT name FROM people WHERE name = 'Roddy Daly';
